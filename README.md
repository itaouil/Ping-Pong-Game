# **Ping-Pong-Game**

This a simple game where the players can fight each other at who is the best at ping pong. The game uses the following technologies:

1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. JavaScript (JQuery)

### Key Points

The key points in the code are the following:

1. **How to use JQuery to interact with the DOM, by modifying css styles and displaying dynamic text.**

2. **User Input handling with multiple keys down support (array and interval iteration).**

3. **Collision detection (still wonky though) :).**
